            <h1>Spiritual Reflections</h1>
            <p>
                The path to salvation all mortals seek,<br>
                And before you lie a million such.<br>
                A choice is to be made by thee, O son of man.<br><br>

                Before you stands the path of the enlightened,<br>
                Before you, countless ways that claim the truth.<br>
                The choice is thine, O sinner,<br>
                Choose the road thy soul accepts as true.<br><br>

                To walk with a thousand gods, some have chosen,<br>
                To bow in submission, others too,<br>
                To deny the name of God, some hearts have chosen,<br>
                Yet by divine grace, thou art forgiven and chosen.<br><br>

                Arise, O sinner, clothed in crimson grace,<br>
                Walk forth, for thy Lord hath died for thee,<br>
                Accept thy salvation, lift thy head high,<br>
                For none can claim what the Lord God calls mine.<br><br>

                At the table of gold we shall dine with Him after judgment,<br>
                And an eternity of joy our Lord hath promised.<br>
                Let my faith not shake nor waver,<br>
                For I have chosen to walk with Thee and shall never turn back.
