                <strong>Black and white chains</strong><br><br>

                Destiny and karma play a splendid game of chess,<br>
                Their laughter echoing through my storms of deep distress,<br>
                My joys and plights employed as nothing but their pawns,<br>
                And yet I stand here waiting, longing just to reach the dawn.<br><br>

                Ask not of me who I desire to claim the crown,<br>
                For if karma triumphs, every debt I owe he’ll hunt me down,<br>
                Let’s not call destiny either, for should she seize the lead,<br>
                I become a grain of sand lost in her ever-shifting creed,<br>
                Can I ever break free? I always ponder this with dread.<br><br>

                Tighter and tighter the endless duel begins to spread,<br>
                Both have lost their queen to each other's ruthless hold,<br>
                Neither king is safe, for one checkmate leaves them cold.<br>
                Let my smile not fool you, mortals,<br>
                For my dreams and hope I watch slip like water.<br><br>

                Firmly to the world I voice my insignificance,<br>
                Still yearning for the chance to rise and make my stance.<br>
                A wondrous game, you all call it with carefree glee,<br>
                But have you ever paused to think of me?
